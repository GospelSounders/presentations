                <h1>The Millennial Judgment</h1>
                <h3>A Biblical Study on the Saints' Role in God's Final Judgment</h3>
                <p><em>Based on Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy</em></p>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Welcome to this comprehensive study on the millennial judgment. This presentation will trace the historical shift from the biblical pioneer understanding to modern erroneous views that actually cultivate doubt about God's justice.
                    
                    Key themes we'll cover:
                    - What modern Adventists believe today
                    - What the pioneers taught
                    - How the shift occurred
                    - The theological dangers of the new view
                    - The biblical correction
                    
                    This study is based on Brian Onang'o's paper "Correcting the Infidel Views of The Millennial Judgment That Cultivate Doubt over the Justice of God" (October 29, 2020).

                <h2>If You Asked a Postmodern Adventist...</h2>
                <div class="modern-view">
                    <p><strong>"What will the saints be doing during the millennium?"</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Going through records to see why loved ones are lost"</li>
                        <li>"Questioning God's decisions to make sure they're fair"</li>
                        <li>"Getting answers about God's justice"</li>
                        <li>"Reviewing why enemies are saved and friends are lost"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    This is the current popular understanding in modern Adventism. But this view is actually:
                    1. Not found in Questions on Doctrine (1957)
                    2. Not taught by the pioneers
                    3. Not supported by Ellen White
                    4. Actually promotes doubt about God's character
                    
                    The document we're studying calls this "infidelity" - and we'll see why.
                    
                    From Sabbath School Lesson 2019: "During the millennium, God allows the redeemed to access the records of history in order to find answers to all questions concerning the fairness of His decisions regarding those who were lost."
                    
                    This teaching suggests saints will be "judging God" rather than judging the wicked.

            <!-- The Revelation 20:4 Foundation -->
            <section data-background="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578662996442-48f60103fc96?auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80" data-background-opacity="0.2">
                <h2>The Biblical Foundation</h2>
                <div class="verse">
                    "I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them"<br>
                    <strong>- Revelation 20:4</strong>
                </div>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"<br>
                    <strong>- 1 Corinthians 6:2-3</strong>
                </div>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    These are the foundational texts. But the question is: What does this judgment involve?
                    
                    Full context of 1 Corinthians 6:1-3:
                    "Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
                    
                    The original understanding was clear - this is about determining punishment, not questioning God's decisions.
                    
                    Additional supporting texts:
                    - Daniel 7:22: "judgment was given to the saints of the most High"
                    - Matthew 19:28: "ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel"
                    - Revelation 2:26-27: "he shall rule them with a rod of iron"

                <h2>What the Adventist Pioneers Taught</h2>
                
                <div class="pioneer-view">
                    <h3>Questions on Doctrine (1957):</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The work of judgment may well involve a careful investigation of the records of evil men and a decision regarding the amount of punishment due each sinner for his part in the rebellion against God."
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pioneer-view">
                    <h3>Sabbath School Lesson (1937):</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The executive judgment takes place during the one thousand years... Men will be judged and sentenced according to their works."
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    The pioneers were crystal clear - the millennial judgment is about:
                    1. Investigating records of the WICKED (not reviewing God's decisions)
                    2. Determining the AMOUNT OF PUNISHMENT due each sinner
                    3. SENTENCING according to their works
                    
                    This was the consistent understanding from the 1870s through the 1950s.
                    
                    From the Fundamental Principles of 1872, which were said to be "the fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last fifty years."
                    
                    Even as late as 2014, Miguel noted that the millennium doctrine "has resisted the analysis and revisions during of the following decades that lead until the present time" - but this is no longer true.

                        "In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Ellen White could not be clearer:
                    
                    1. Saints work "IN UNION WITH CHRIST" - not independently reviewing His decisions
                    2. They judge THE WICKED - not God's character
                    3. They determine PUNISHMENT - not question God's justice
                    4. NONE will question God's justice - the righteous will have perfect faith
                    
                    Full quote from RH March 12, 1901: "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.' God has laid the work of judgment upon Christ because He is the Son of man. He was made in all points like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest. He was to become acquainted with the weakness of every human being. He could do this only by taking upon himself human nature. He must be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, that at the judgment of the great day none might question the justice of the decisions made."
                    
                    Notice: "NONE might question" - this directly contradicts the modern view!

            <!-- The Shift Begins -->
            <section data-background="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1419242902214-272b3f66ee7a?auto=format&fit=crop&w=2026&q=80" data-background-opacity="0.2">
                <h2>How the Shift Occurred</h2>
                
                <div class="warning">
                    <h3>The Mervyn Maxwell Influence</h3>
                    <p>The shift began with scholars like Mervyn Maxwell introducing the concept that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Christ is both Judge AND Advocate simultaneously</li>
                        <li>God needs to "justify His ways" to created beings</li>
                        <li>Saints will "examine God's ways and judgment"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="modern-view">
                    <p><strong>Maxwell's Teaching:</strong> "Jesus, our Attorney and Judge... If, then, Jesus plays a dual role in the judgment, serving both as our advocate and as our judge..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    The theological shift can be traced to specific scholars, particularly Mervyn Maxwell, whose book "God Cares" introduced several problematic concepts:
                    
                    1. Christ as both Judge and Advocate (which Ellen White clearly says is NOT the case)
                    2. The idea that God needs to justify Himself to creatures
                    3. The concept of "theodicy" - justifying God's ways to men
                    
                    From Maxwell's "God Cares": "They will confirm to their eternal satisfaction how earnestly and patiently God cared for lost sinners. They will perceive how heedlessly and stubbornly sinners spurned and rejected His love."
                    
                    This language suggests saints need to be "convinced" of God's fairness - which directly contradicts Ellen White's statement that "none might question the justice of the decisions made."
                    
                    The influence spread through "Seventh-day Adventists Believe..." (1988) and then into Sabbath School lessons.

                    The church's teaching on judgment phases is contradictory:
                    
                    Different sources say:
                    - "Three phases" (Sabbath School 2012)
                    - "Four phases" (Sabbath School 1988)
                    - Executive judgment "at the end" vs "during" the millennium
                    
                    But Jude 14-15 is crystal clear: "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
                    
                    Ellen White confirms this in Great Controversy p. 425: "Besides the coming of the Lord to His temple, Malachi also foretells His second advent, His coming for the execution of the judgment, in these words... Jude refers to the same scene when he says, 'Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.'"
                    
                    The "ten thousands of saints" here refers to ANGELS, not redeemed humans, as confirmed by multiple texts and Ellen White.

                    <blockquote>
                        "The Ancient of Days is God the Father... It is He, the source of all being, and the fountain of all law, that is to preside in the judgment. And holy angels as ministers and witnesses, in number 'ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,' attend this great tribunal."

                </div>
                
                <div class="verse">
                    "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son"<br>
                    <strong>- John 5:22</strong>

                    This is crucial to understand:
                    
                    1. FATHER presides in investigative judgment (Daniel 7:9-10, GC 479)
                    2. SON executes the judgment decisions (John 5:27)
                    3. Christ is NOT both judge and advocate simultaneously
                    
                    The distinction is clear:
                    - Father judges (investigative phase)
                    - Son executes (executive phase)
                    - Saints participate in determining punishments (millennial phase)
                    
                    Christ's three-fold office according to A.T. Jones:
                    1. Prophet (on earth - past)
                    2. Priest (in heaven - present) 
                    3. King (at Second Coming - future)
                    
                    These are SUCCESSIVE, not simultaneous offices.
                    
                    Maxwell's error of making Christ both judge and advocate creates the foundation for the false millennial judgment doctrine.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The modern church teaching explicitly states that:
                    
                    1. Saints will question God's fairness
                    2. Saints need to be "satisfied" with God's decisions
                    3. Saints will review God's "leading in their own lives"
                    4. This is necessary to prevent future sin
                    
                    From various modern sources:
                    - "The redeemed will be free to explore the 'books of heaven,' getting answers to questions about God, about those we loved who are not there"
                    - "There may be people there you didn't like or didn't expect to see in heaven"
                    - "Some whom we hope and expect will be saved may not be there"
                    
                    This teaching promotes:
                    1. Doubt about God's character
                    2. Questioning God's justice
                    3. Lack of faith in God's decisions
                    4. Human reasoning above divine wisdom
                    
                    It's based on conjecture: "I am of the opinion...", "Perhaps...", "it may take some...", "Such a case might..." rather than clear biblical statements.

                    The document calls the modern view "infidelity" because it:
                    
                    1. Contradicts clear biblical statements
                    2. Contradicts Ellen White's explicit teachings
                    3. Promotes doubt where faith should reign
                    4. Makes saints judges of God rather than servants of God
                    
                    The concept of "theodicy" (justifying God's ways to men) is fundamentally flawed:
                    
                    From Great Controversy p. 492: "There are those who, in their inquiries concerning the existence of sin, endeavor to search into that which God has never revealed; hence they find no solution of their difficulties; and such as are actuated by a disposition to doubt and cavil seize upon this as an excuse for rejecting the words of Holy Writ."
                    
                    Uriah Smith noted that theodicy was a pagan concept: "No theodicy ever devised in the pagan world has ever made any such provision."
                    
                    The solution is not explaining God's ways, but trusting His revealed character through faith.
                    
                    Ellen White: "God never asks us to believe, without giving sufficient evidence upon which to base our faith... Our faith must rest upon evidence, not demonstration." (Steps to Christ 105)

                    This is the heart of the issue - faith vs. doubt:
                    
                    The righteous will enter heaven with perfect faith in God's character. They will not need to:
                    - Question why some are lost
                    - Verify God's decisions
                    - Get "answers about God"

                    From Great Controversy 622: "Those who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest danger of falling under the power of satanic delusions and the decree to compel the conscience. And even if they endure the test they will be plunged into deeper distress and anguish in the time of trouble, because they have never made it a habit to trust in God."
                    
                    The whole universe will vindicate God's justice:
                    Revelation 16:5-7: "And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord... true and righteous are thy judgments."

                    By the time of the millennium, all questions about God's character will be settled through faith, not investigation.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Jude 15 makes this crystal clear - it's "all that are UNGODLY among them" who need to be convinced of their ungodly deeds.
                    
                    The righteous don't need convincing because:
                    1. They have faith in God's character
                    2. They trust His justice implicitly
                    3. They've already settled these questions through Scripture and experience
                    
                    The document notes: "We believe that this very fact, that the righteous implicitly believe in God's ways and His judgments, bought out by the text in Jude, is the repulsive point that the doctrine of the 3-phase judgment seeks to obscure."
                    
                    The new teaching essentially makes the saints into doubters who need convincing - which contradicts their character as faithful believers.
                    
                    From Hebrews 3:18-19: "And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
                    
                    Unbelief keeps people OUT of God's rest. Those who enter heaven will have perfect faith.

                    This is about:
                    1. Their own spiritual experience
                    2. God's grace in their salvation
                    3. Their service for others
                    4. God's faithfulness through trials
                    
                    NOT about questioning God's decisions or getting "answers about God."
                    
                    The saints will also be doing the actual work of judgment - determining appropriate punishment for the wicked based on their deeds, as clearly stated in Great Controversy 660.

                    <blockquote>
                        "No theodicy ever devised in the pagan world has ever made any such provision."

                    The concept driving the modern millennial judgment teaching is "theodicy" - a term coined by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1710, but the concept goes back to pagan Greek philosophy.
                    
                    Cliff Goldstein (who promotes the modern view) openly admits this is theodicy: "What's amazing about theodicy isn't so much that God can, ultimately, justify His ways before us, but that He would consent to do so."
                    
                    This is fundamentally flawed because:
                    1. It assumes God needs to justify Himself to creatures
                    2. It promotes human reason as judge over divine wisdom  
                    3. It's rooted in pagan philosophy, not biblical revelation
                    4. It contradicts the biblical principle that we walk by faith, not sight
                    
                    Uriah Smith contrasted pagan theodicy with biblical revelation: "It is not the teaching of revelation that there should be an attempt to counteract the sorrows of bereavement by mere human stoicism; but the sorrow is to be mollified by the hope of the gospel."
                    
                    The solution is not philosophical explanations but gospel faith.
                    
                    Ellen White never used the term "theodicy" in all her writings - the angels never chose that word for her.

                    Maxwell's fundamental error is making Christ both Judge and Advocate simultaneously. This creates an unjust judicial system and leads to the false millennial judgment teaching.
                    
                    The Bible and Ellen White are clear:
                    1. FATHER presides in investigative judgment (Daniel 7:9-10)
                    2. SON executes the judgment after it's complete (John 5:27)
                    3. These are distinct roles, not simultaneous
                    
                    Maxwell asks: "Who is the judge?" Then tries to solve the "riddle" of John 5:22 ("the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son") by making Christ both.
                    
                    But there's no riddle:
                    - Father judges (investigative phase)
                    - Son executes (executive phase) 
                    - Different phases, different roles
                    
                    Maxwell's view that God needs to justify Himself leads directly to the idea that saints will be "judging God" during the millennium.
                    
                    The document asks: "Can we suppose, in the face of the plain text from Jude, the writings of Ellen White and those of the pioneers, that the authors of 'Seventh-day Adventists Believe...' had no idea about what the Bible and the Spirit of prophecy say?"
                    
                    This appears to be deliberate departure from truth, not innocent error.

                    The document uses the biblical principle "You shall know them by their fruits" to evaluate this doctrine.
                    
                    The modern teaching actually promotes:
                    1. Hatred for others ("people you didn't like")
                    2. Surprise at God's decisions (lack of faith)
                    3. Need for "healing" from selfish attitudes
                    4. Questioning God's justice
                    
                    But Christ commands: "Love your enemies... Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
                    
                    The document notes: "The leaves of the tree of life have been made a means of healing a wicked heart that desires not that another should go to heaven!"
                    
                    This completely corrupts the meaning of Revelation 22:2 about the leaves for healing.
                    
                    True saints will:
                    1. Love even their former enemies
                    2. Trust God's perfect judgment
                    3. Have no hatred requiring healing
                    4. Rejoice in God's justice and mercy
                    
                    The fact that this teaching produces such unChristlike attitudes proves it's false.

                <aside class="notes">
                    This is profound - the modern teaching promotes the very attitude that caused Lucifer's fall!
                    
                    Lucifer's sin was:
                    1. Wanting access to God's secret counsels
                    2. Demanding to understand God's purposes
                    3. Questioning whether God was worthy of trust
                    4. Desiring equality with God in knowledge
                    
                    The modern millennial judgment teaching promotes:
                    1. Saints getting access to all of God's records
                    2. Understanding all of God's decisions
                    3. Judging whether God is "worthy to live with"
                    4. Elevating human reason to divine level
                    
                    The document quotes: "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law." (Deuteronomy 29:29)
                    
                    God has never promised to reveal all His secrets. From the beginning, only Christ could "enter into all the counsels and purposes of God."
                    
                    The modern teaching essentially makes every saint into another Lucifer, demanding access to divine counsels and judging God's worthiness.
                    
                    "Let it be remembered that 'The secret [things belong] unto the LORD our God: but those [things which are] revealed [belong] unto us and to our children for ever, that [we] may do all the words of this law.'"

                    The solution is not investigation but faith based on already revealed evidence:
                    
                    1. God has already provided sufficient evidence of His character
                    2. The cross demonstrates His love and justice perfectly
                    3. Faith, not sight, is the basis of our relationship with God
                    4. Those who enter heaven will have settled all questions through faith
                    
                    From Great Controversy 492: "Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in the divine government, that gave occasion for the uprising of rebellion."
                    
                    The evidence is already available:
                    - Scripture reveals God's character
                    - The cross demonstrates His love
                    - Providence shows His care
                    - The Spirit testifies to our hearts
                    
                    We don't need a millennial investigation. We need present faith.
                    
                    "The wages of sin is death" - if anyone is lost, it's because of their sin, not God's injustice.
                    
                    The document concludes: "Remember that when God sent His only begotten Son to live, leave, an example for the guilty race of Adam and finally to offer Himself an acceptable sacrifice for sin, it was at 'the risk of failure and eternal loss' - DA p. 131.2. God would not have admitted His own divine Son back into heaven if he would have sinned. And shall he receive your rebellious kith and kin?"

                    The modern teaching suggests: By letting saints investigate God's character and decisions until they're satisfied.
                    
                    But the biblical answer is: By admitting only those who have perfect faith in God's character through revelation, not investigation.
                    
                    The document states: "Heaven will not again by infidelity be brought into jeopardy. 'Affliction shall not rise up the second time.' Nahum 1:9. How does God propose to do this? – Of course, answers the church - 'God allows the redeemed to access the records of history in order to find answers to all questions concerning the fairness of His decisions regarding those who were lost, as well as questions dealing with His leading in their own lives. At the conclusion of the millennium, all questions regarding God's justice are forever settled.'"
                    
                    But this approach actually cultivates the very attitudes that caused the first rebellion!
                    
                    The true solution:
                    1. Those who enter heaven will have perfect faith NOW
                    2. They will trust God's character completely 
                    3. They will love His law and justice
                    4. They will have no desire to question His decisions
                    
                    "It is upon the same condition of wholly trusting in God that the saint will be admitted into heaven."

                <div class="verse">
                    "Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things."<br>
                    <strong>- Matthew 17:11</strong>
                </div>
                
                <div class="egw-quote">
                    <h3>The Promise:</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        "And the promise is sure, that 'the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world' will light upon them."
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                
                <div class="warning">
                    <h3>The Urgency:</h3>
                    <p>We must return to the biblical truth before it's too late. Truth seekers must "shut their ears to cant, empty themselves of pride and prejudice, and re-examine all points that they hold as truth."</p>
                </div>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    The document concludes with a call to return to biblical truth:
                    
                    "When we consider that the last work of reformation, represented under the figure of Elijah is said to have the express purpose of restoring all things, then it is no conjecture to suppose that during the time of this Elias, all things will have been pulled down and in need of restoration."
                    
                    The millennial judgment doctrine is one of those things that needs restoration to its original biblical truth.
                    
                    The call is urgent:
                    1. Study this subject carefully
                    2. Compare modern teaching with Scripture and Ellen White
                    3. Return to the pioneer understanding
                    4. Reject human reasoning that exalts itself above God
                    5. Trust in God's revealed character through faith
                    
                    "It is therefore our plea to the men of talent and ability to study this subject. Then God will enable them to send forth the truth to catch up with and vanquish the error as they vindicate the justice of God."
                    
                    The choice is clear:
                    - Faith or doubt
                    - Biblical truth or human reasoning  
                    - Pioneer understanding or modern innovation
                    - Trust in God's character or investigation of it
                    
                    "That believing, God will give them more light with which to further polish this 'distinctive doctrine'."

                    In conclusion, this study has revealed:
                    
                    1. The modern millennial judgment teaching contradicts Scripture, Ellen White, and the pioneers
                    2. It promotes doubt about God's character rather than faith
                    3. It's rooted in pagan theodicy rather than biblical revelation
                    4. It cultivates the very attitudes that caused Lucifer's fall
                    5. The biblical teaching promotes faith, trust, and union with Christ
                    
                    The call is clear: Return to the biblical truth that:
                    - Saints judge the wicked, determining their punishment
                    - Saints work in perfect union with Christ
                    - Saints enter heaven with complete faith in God's character
                    - No investigation of God's character is needed
                    - Sin will never rise again because only the faithful enter heaven
                    
                    The choice before every truth seeker:
                    Will you believe the clear teachings of Scripture and Ellen White, or will you accept modern innovations that promote doubt about God's character?
                    
                    "See yourself in heaven beside Jesus, under the employ of the Father, a co-laborer together with him. Hate evil today and the Father will give you a place in the work of eradicating it."
                    
                    May God grant wisdom to choose truth over error, faith over doubt, and the pioneer foundation over modern innovation.
